Welcome to my homepage !
I'm currently a PhD student, working at [CEA List](https://list.cea.fr/fr/), in the Laboratory of Semantic Analysis of Texts and Images (LASTI).

Open to PhD internship positions for 2023-2024!
## Current Work
My work revolves around the development of new deep learning profiling and recommendation methods which  can ensure the user's privacy and control over their data. 
More specifically, I focus on the kind on information contained in user images, instead of relying on an explicit user feedback.

## Interests
Throughout my scholarship and work experience, I have gained interest in many aspects of deep learning, with a preference for:
- Computer Vision
- NLP
- Generative models
- Geometric Deep Learning
