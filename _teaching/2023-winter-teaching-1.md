Introductory course to Deep Learning in Practice, with practical sessions in Pytorch.

## Program
- elementary blocks from signal processing and statistics: spatial and temporal convolutions, activation functions, compositions
- automatic differentiation: gradients, jacobians
- review of a few famous nets for vision applications: AlexNet, Resnet,...
- stochastic optimization of parameters for non-convex problems (RMSprop, ADAM etc..)
- theory: convex models for simple two-layer perceptrons; network structure optimization 
- recurrent networks and the vanishing gradient problem, LSTM, memory and attention mechanisms.
- deep networks in action: GANs and VAEs
- applications to structured data: graph NN.
